# jQuery

## Overview

- JQuery is by far the most popular JavaScript library
- It is written in JavaScript and provides a more convenient syntax, a host of
  pre-built effects and animations, and automatic cross-browser compatibility
  for many JavaScript operations
- Using jQuery makes your code **less efficient** (every operation using jQuery
  requires a bit more processing time) but produces a massive increase in code
  economy (i.e. **shorter code**) and allows for much shorter development times
- Suppose you wanted to immediately hide all `<div>` elements with their `class`
  attribute set to `aside`
- Raw JavaScript:
  ```js
  let ds = document.querySelectorAll("div.aside");

  for (let i = 0; i < ds.length; i++) {
    ds[i].style.display = "none";
  }
  ```
- Same thing using jQuery:
  ```js
  $("div.aside").hide();
  ```
- The jQuery version will execute more slowly because you are calling two extra
  functions (the `$` function and the `hide` method)
- Between them, this function and method will do the work of calling
  `querySelectorAll` and looping through the results
- But it is faster to write, easier to look at, and the user will almost never
  notice the difference in speed

## Installation

- To use jQuery in your code, you must load it using a `<script>` element
- Make sure you load jQuery before you load any code that relies on it
- You can load jQuery in one of two ways:
- Download the latest compressed version from jQuery.com, include it in your
  `js/` folder, and then load it in a `<script>` element, like this:
  ```html
  <script src="js/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>
  ```
- Or you can download the latest version from the Google repository, like this:
  ```html
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  ```
- Version can be different as of latest release.

## Hello, World!

- A `<script>` element that loads jQuery from the Google repository
- You can load html file into Chrome, open the JavaScript Console, and type the
  following to set the `innerHTML` of the `<div>` element to `"Hello, World!"`:
  ```js
  $("div").html("Hello, World!");
  ```

## The `$` function and the jQuery object

- Everything you will do with the jQuery library will be based on the `$`
  function, which is an alias for the jQuery function
- You can use either jQuery or `$` in your code
- The `$` function takes a string argument that contains a jQuery selector and
  returns a jQuery object that contains all the elements that matched the
  selector
- Most legal CSS selectors are also legal jQuery selectors
- The jQuery object returned by `$` can be treated as an array of DOM elements,
  but it also contains a set of built in methods for DOM manipulation that are
  usually much easier to use than their raw JavaScript counterparts
- The `"Hello, World!"` program above uses the `$` function to retrieve all
  `<div>` elements from the DOM, and then calls the `html` method of the jQuery
  object to set their contents
- If there had been more than one `<div>` element on the page, they all would
  have changed

## Getting content, style, and attributes

- Four commonly-used jQuery methods are `html("content")`, `css("style")`,
  `val(value of an <input> element)` and `attr(for setting attributes)`
- Each method can be used to get or set parts of the DOM
- If the jQuery selector matches more than one element, the expression will
  return the value for the first matching element

| jQuery Expression                                         | Raw JavaScript Equivalent                           |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `$("#instructions").html()`                               | `document.getElementById("instructions").innerHTML` |
| `$("a").attr("href")`                                     | `document.querySelectorAll("a")[0].href`            |
| `$("[type=text]").val()`                                  | `document.querySelectorAll("[type=text]")[0].value` |
| `$("#heading").css("font-size")`                          | N/A                                                 |

- The `css` method is a very powerful addition to JavaScript because it will
  search through all the rules in stylesheets and default browser styles looking
  for the value that currently applies to the element
- The `style` field built into raw JavaScript, on the other hand, only accesses
  information contained in the `style` attribute

## Setting content, style, and attributes

- To use the `html`, `css`, `val`, and `attr` methods as set methods, add a
  string argument for the value you want to set
- This will cause every item that matches the selector to be set to that value
  ```js
  $("td").html("<strong>X</strong>");
  $("a").attr("href", "http://google.com");
  $("[type=text]").val("Hello, World!");
  $("td").css("color", "white");
  ```

## Chaining

- Every jQuery object method returns the jQuery object itself
- This allows jQuery methods to be chained as many times as you like
- Here's a single command that changes two CSS properties along with the
  `innerHTML` and the `href` attribute for every link on the current page:
  ```js
  $("a")
    .css("color", "white")
    .css("background-color", "black")
    .html("Link Changed")
    .attr("href", "[http://example.com](http://example.com)");
  ```
- To set multiple CSS values at once, you can also pass an object argument to
  the `css` method with properties specified as instance variables
  ```js
  $("a").css({
    color: "white",
    backgroundColor: "black",
    textDecoration: "underline",
  });
  ```

## Classes

- The jQuery library contains methods for dealing more easily with HTML classes
  ```js
  $("td").toggleClass("odd").toggleClass("even");
  ```

| Method                     | Description                                                                  |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `addClass("classname")`    | Adds a class to every selected element                                       |
| `removeClass("classname")` | Removes a class from every selected element                                  |
| `toggleClass("classname")` | Adds or removes a class for every selected element                           |
| `hasClass("classname")`    | Returns true if any of the selected elements have the class, otherwise false |

## Effects and Animations

- The jQuery library also contains methods to make various effects and
  animations easier

### Fading in and out

- Fade component in and out
  ```js
  $("#instructions").fadeOut();
  $("#instructions").fadeIn();

  // Specify duration of fade in ms
  $("#instructions").fadeOut(1000);
  $("#instructions").fadeIn(2000);

  // Fade to opacity 0.5 in 2 seconds
  $("#instructions").fadeTo(2000, 0.5);
  $("td.odd").fadeOut().fadeIn(2000);
  ```
- It seems like the `fadeOut` method on each element completes before the
  `fadeIn` is called
- But that's not really what happens
- Rather, both methods are called immediately and schedule a `fadeOut` followed
  by a `fadeIn` to take place _asynchronously_ for each selected element
  ```js
  $("td.odd").fadeOut().fadeIn(2000).html("X");
  ```
- You will see that the X's seem to appear before the `fadeOut` even starts
- This is because all three methods complete very quickly, one after the other,
  with `fadeOut` and `fadeIn` scheduling _asynchronous_ actions that continue to
  work after the `html` method is finished
- If you want to schedule something to happen after an animation has completed,
  you must use a callback function
- This function is passed as an optional argument to the method
- Uses a callback function to change each component's `innerHTML` after the
  `fadeIn` has completed
  ```js
  $("td.odd").fadeOut().fadeIn(2000, () => {
    $(this).html("X");
  });
  ```
- Note the use of `$(this)` in the callback function above
- In jQuery, `$(this)` returns a jQuery object containing the DOM element that
  the callback function is attached to
- In the example above, a copy of the callback function gets attached to each of
  the elements selected by the `td.odd` selector
- Using `$(this)` means that each of these elements will then have the `html`
  method applied to it once the `fadeOut` for that element has completed
- Note that to be most effective, the fade methods should usually only be
  applied to elements with absolute position
- See what happens if the elements do not have absolute position:
  ```js
  $("td.odd").fadeOut();
  ```

### Sliding

- The `slideUp`, `slideDown`, `hide`, and `show` methods work just like `fadeIn`
  and `fadeout`
- You can also specify optional duration and callback function arguments:
  ```js
  $("#instructions").slideUp();
  $("#instructions").slideDown();
  $("#instructions").hide();
  $("#instructions").show();
  ```
- The `hide` and `show` methods have a duration of `0` by default, which makes
  the effect instantaneous
- For an animated hide or show, sliding in and out from the top left corner, you
  can specify a duration

## Animation

- The `animate` method needs at least one object argument to specify a set of
  CSS values to "move towards"
- It also has an optional second parameter for duration and third for a callback
  function
- The `animate` method only works for numeric CSS properties
  ```js
  $("#instructions").animate({ borderWidth: "10px" });
  $("#instructions").animate({ fontSize: "30px", width: "600px" }, 2000);
  $("#instructions").animate({ width: "300px" }, 1000, () => {
      $(this).css("background-color": "white");
  });
  ```

## Events and Listeners in jQuery

- The jQuery library contains its own event management system that extends the
  regular HTML and JavaScript system to make it more robust, readable, and
  compatible with all browsers
- Listeners are added to elements by chaining an event method onto the `$`
  function, like this:
  ```js
  $("selector").event(listener);
  ```
- In the above, event is an event name and listener is a function that receives
  an event object argument
- The following event methods are supported for ordinary HTML elements:
  - `click`, `dblclick`, `mouseenter`, `mouseleave`, `keydown`, `keyup`
- For form elements, the following are supported:
  - `submit`, `change`, `focus`, `blur`
- Note that the `input` event type is not supported, use `keyup` instead
- Each event method can also be called with no arguments to trigger the event in
  question

## Using the `$` function without a selector

- The jQuery `$` function is usually called with a string selector as its
  argument
- When used in this way, it returns a jQuery object containing all the matching
  elements
- But you can also give the `$` function a single DOM node or nodelist as an
  argument
- It will return a jQuery object containing the nodes you gave it
- This allows you to chain jQuery methods onto a set of DOM elements regardless
  of how you retrieved them
- This is not a suggestion of a good way to use the jQuery function, it's just
  showing you the function's flexibility
  ```js
  let e = document.getElementById("instructions");
  $(e).html("changed");

  $(document.querySelectorAll("td"))
    .toggleClass("odd")
    .toggleClass("even");
  ```
- The main use of this feature is in listeners and callback functions where
  `$(this)` can be helpful to chain jQuery methods onto the element that the
  function or listener is attached to
- This command adds a click listener to every `<td>` element on the page
- When a `<td>` element is clicked, the listener uses `$(this)` to perform
  actions on it
  ```js
  $("td").click(function () {
    $(this).toggleClass("odd").toggleClass("even");
  });
  ```

## Where to add listeners

- Just like in raw JavaScript, you must make sure the DOM is loaded before you
  attach listeners using jQuery
- The jQuery library provides a special `ready` function that you can attach to
  the document object for this purpose
  ```js
  $(document).ready(function () {
    console.log("put your code here!");
  });
  ```
- The above code creates a jQuery object with the document object as its
  contents, then attaches a listener to its `ready` event
- The `ready` event is a special event implemented by jQuery
- It fires when the DOM has been fully built, but before external content like
  images and other files have been loaded
- This means it fires before the standard `window`'s `load` event, which waits
  until all images and other content are loaded before it fires
- Most jQuery developers prefer to use the `ready` event for the `document`
  object because it makes the app fully functional more quickly

## Advanced DOM manipulation with jQuery

- You already know how to use a node's `innerHTML` or the jQuery `html` method
  to make changes to a given element
- But adding and removing elements from the DOM by making changes to the
  `innerHTML` string often requires quite tricky and error-prone string
  manipulations
- There are more sophisticated ways of finding, deleting, and inserting things
  elements, using special fields and methods for DOM tree traversal, element
  creation, insertion and removal
- If you want to work in raw JavaScript, you can But jQuery, as usual, provides
  a much nicer interface

## Review of the DOM Tree

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>DOM Example</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
    </head>
<body>
    <div id="div1">This div has ID "div1"</div>
    <div>This div has no ID</div>
</body>
</html>
```

- The DOM Tree above is a bit of an oversimplification
- The true picture is more complicated and contains `TextNode` elements in
  addition to the `Node` elements shown
- If you try to do DOM traversal and manipulation in raw JavaScript, you must
  take those extra elements into account
- But jQuery shields us from this added complexity

## Dom tree traversal

- To traverse the DOM is to move from one node in the DOM tree to another by
  accessing links to its parent, children, and siblings
- The basic jQuery methods for navigation are:
  ```js
  children(); // Selects the set of child nodes of each node in the jQuery object
  parent(); // Selects the parent node of each node in the jQuery object
  siblings(); // Selects the sibling nodes of each node in the jQuery object
  ```
  ```js
  $("body").children();
  $("body").parent();
  $("body").parent().parent();
  $("body").children().parent();
  $("body").children().children();
  ```
- If you want to pick out one specific child of a node, you can start with the
  first or last child and then move backwards or forwards through the siblings
  using these methods:
  ```js
  first(); // selects the first item from the list of nodes in the jQuery object
  last(); // selects the last item from the list of nodes in the jQuery object
  next(); // selects the next sibling (if there is one) of each node in the jQuery object
  prev(); // selects the previous sibling (if there is one) of each node in the jQuery object
  ```
- The following command will change the text of the first child of the `<body>`
  element to `1`
  ```js
  $("body").children().first().html("1");
  ```

## Node removal

- Removing a specific node is tricky in raw JavaScript, but jQuery has a
  `remove` method that makes it easy to select and remove nodes from the DOM
  ```js
  $("#div1").remove();
  ```

## Node insertion

- To insert you have to create a new node, and then add it somewhere in the DOM
  tree
- The basic jQuery methods for insertion are summarized below:
  ```js
  append():  // adds a node as the last child of each selected element
  prepend(): // adds a node as the first child of each selected element
  before():  // inserts a node as the previous sibling of each selected element
  after():   // inserts a node as the next sibling of each selected element
  ```
- The simplest way to use these methods is to pass a string argument containing
  HTML code for the new node you wish to insert
- The following will append a new `<div>` element to the `<body>`
  ```js
  $("body").append("<div>Hello!</div>");
  ```
- The following will add new `<div>` elements after each of the children of the
  `<body>`:
  ```js
  $("body").children().after("<div>Goodbye!</div>");
  ```

## Creating new nodes

- Adding nodes using an HTML string is sometimes convenient, but can be
  cumbersome if the nodes you are adding contain a lot of attributes
- As an alternative, you can create new `Node` elements using the jQuery `$`
  function
- You do this by passing an HTML tag as an argument to the `$` function
- For example, `$("<p>")` creates a new paragraph element
- Once a node has been created in this way you can save it in a variable, modify
  it with chained jQuery methods, and then add it (or multiple copies of it) to
  the DOM when you are ready
- This will create a new paragraph element and adds a copy of it to each div:
  ```js
  let node = $("<p>").html("Hello, World!")
    .css("color", "aqua")
    .attr("title", "Quit Hovering!");

  $("body").children().append(node);
  ```
