Hello,

I am writing to express my interest in the Materials Engineer - Student position at ABC Company. I am currently enrolled in the Quality Engineering Technician (NDE) program at Mohawk College and am seeking my co-op work term (up to one year in length, commencing in September).

My coursework has provided me with hands-on experience in Welding and Failure Analysis, as well as comprehensive knowledge in Corrosion and inspection procedures. My three years of experience in the customer service field have honed my communication, time management, and interpersonal skills. I am committed to fostering a collaborative work environment and have received recognition for my leadership abilities and dedication to maintaining a safe work atmosphere.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further. Please contact me at mitulvaghmashi@gmail.com to schedule a meeting.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Mitul Vaghamshi
