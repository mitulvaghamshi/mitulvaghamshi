## Action Verbs

- Beginning each bulleted accomplishment statement with a strong action verb helps to highlight your successes and allows a reader to get a sense of your skills by scanning the page prior to reading each individual bullet point.
- It is a good idea to vary the action verbs on your resume in order to appeal to different audiences.
