# Presentation Skills

Presentation skills include methods for presenting your content as well as public speaking techniques. This document will attempt to cover a number of these skills and helpful techniques to produce the most effective presentation.

No matter what you do, practicing and double checking the equipment, having backups and practicing again will be your best use of time.

## Presentation Structure

Many effective presentations are structured using a 3 step approach - tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, then tell them that you told them. An effective presentation can also end with a question or two as food for thought. Opener

At the beginning of a presentation, introduce yourself. If you are using PowerPoint, make sure your name and contact information is on the first slide.

One purpose for the opener is to relax yourself and make a connection with the audience. Many people do this with some humor, so a humorous slide, a short 'related' joke, an anecdote, are all suitable parts of the opener. This is not usually a good thing to ad-lib.

### Introduction

The purpose of the introduction is to give an overall purpose of your presentation. What are the main points?

Some speakers choose to actually make their conclusion known in the introduction itself and this is quite suitable.

For example, one would say "I have chosen the WXY network connection package because of its unique features such as ABC. In the next 15 minutes I will illustrate why I have come to this conclusion".

Another method is to keep the conclusion 'secret', allowing the audience itself to reach the same conclusion as you have.

### Body of the Presentation

The body of the presentation should flow logically from one point to the next. If you are using PowerPoint slides, limit the text to short phrases, using 3-7 points per slide.

Even better, use pictures or diagrams without any text bullets at all. Your PowerPoint presentation should enhance your oral presentation and should not be a detailed report. Using animation to display one point at a time is an effective way to focus the attention of the audience on a specific topic.

### Strong Close

The Close or conclusion of your presentation should consist of a brief summary of your main points and a culminating statement if appropriate.

If the purpose of your presentation was to provide rationale for a decision or product recommendation, it would be appropriate to recap the main argument, with a culminating statement indicating the decision or product that was supported.

If it's appropriate to your content, a thought provoking statement or question can be effective in a closing slide.

## Effective Presentation Skills

The following skills may seem like "common sense", but if you haven't had the opportunity to do much public speaking, it can be a bit overwhelming. Each time you make a presentation, try to improve at least one of these areas.

### Eye Contact

When speaking, it is very important to maintain some eye contact with your audience. People do not want to watch the top of the head of a speaker as he/she reads a report. Nor do they want to see the back of the person as they talk to the screen or the board.

Attempt to look at the audience frequently... Careful though, don't only look at the same person or side of the room. Sweep the entire room and try not to center any individual out, including the evaluator of your session.

It would be good to have friends planted in a spot where they could give you a smile or thumbs up to keep you going and give you someone to start the sweep of the room with.

### Voice Control

We all remember how difficult it is to sit in a room listening to someone drone on about something you are only remotely interested in. Don't be guilty of this. Raise and lower your voice, pause frequently, maintain a voice level that can be heard right to the back of the room.

Try not to trail off at the end of sentences and then yell at the beginning of the next sentence. Look for clues from your audience - are they straining to hear you? Do they seem like they are following what you are saying? Watch out for space fillers like "um" and "ah".

A second or two of silence is better than using one of these fillers. You may think it seems like an eternity when you pause, but the audience will barely notice it. In fact, a few seconds pause is useful for the audience to absorb the point you're discussing.

Try to enunciate a bit more clearly than you would when chatting with a friend, and try to slow your speech just a bit more than you would in a normal conversation. Your voice will carry across the room better and the audience will have some time to read the slide while you talk.

### Mannerisms

We all have mannerisms that can be very distracting during a presentation.

Empty your pockets of loose change and put down your pen so you don't end up playing with the change or banging the pen on the desk.

Keeping one hand in a pocket may keep you from waving erratically, but both hands in the pockets is not suitable.

Clinging on to the desk or clenching the podium should also be avoided.

Try walking around a little, perhaps towards the screen and point casually to your slides, maintaining eye contact with your audience as much as possible. Then come back to the desk and check your notes for the next part.

### Enthusiasm

What helps the most in effective presentation skills is the enthusiasm of the speaker. If you sound bored with your topic, the audience will be bored.

Pretend (or maybe this won't be necessary) that your topic is the most exciting thing that you have come across in the last decade.

Talk about it as if it were your favorite football team or music group. This will automatically result in good voice control and often eye contact.
