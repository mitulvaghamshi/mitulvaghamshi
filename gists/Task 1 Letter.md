# Task 1 - Letter - band 7

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to you to inform about a loss of my briefcase which contains a crucial materials related to my work in a bus number 123 operated by your company. I would also like to complain about the service I received when I call the company support.

## (Describe)

I took bus number 123 from Swedish Street to Darwin Road on 15th of April this year, and when I alighted I noticed that my briefcase was missing. It contains company confidential documents, so needless to say the importance of it for me. The whole ride I was sitting at seat 2A, so it is likely that the briefcase simply slipped to the gap between seats to the bus floor.

## (Say)

I immediately made a phone call to the Customer Support hot line, but instead of clear resolution instructions on the case I was told to wait the call back, which still has not happened after 2 days of waiting. I am extremely unhappy on such an attitude as the bus service has pretty established reputation and my case is definitely important.

## (Explain)

May I please kindly ask to address my matter urgently and revert to me rapidly about the status of my briefcase. Also, please, do not hesitate to call me at any time for any details required.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours faithfully,

Mr Alex Blinkov
