## Answer

Advertisements play a vital role for any business to prosper and increase its profit in the industry. The sector which gains the most from this is the fast food or entertainment whose main aim are young children. This essay will discuss how this kind of advertisements may harm the mental and physical health of the children.

One of the biggest problem in the modern times is the obesity in young kids which results from the intake of fast food.

Day by day the food sector has been growing, bringing more unhealthy items which attracts the young minds. The advertisements are presented in a way that they are tempting to the children. For example, a popular fast food chain provides toys with the meals you buy for the kids hence promoting more of the unhealthy food full of fat. Not only does children consume these items, but other members of the family are also forced to have this resulting in the unending loop. These types of ads are to be strictly monitored in order to control the Obesity rate in the world.

The toy industry is not only limited to the physical toys anymore but also consists of all kinds of digital video games such as X-box. As appealing and tempting they may look in the advertisement - they badly affect the mental health of the young minds. These range of toys often demonstrate violence and blood-shed which can produce negative and foul thoughts in their mind for others. This can also result in no physical activity as they would be confined to their homes.

Additionally, not every family is financially equal and can afford expensive toys. Kids have a tendency to always compare their life with friends and not having specific toy can make them feel less of themselves or also a victim of bullying.

In conclusion, advertisements are vitally important for any business to prosper financially and build a mark for them even though I personally believe that there should be some standards set for these. Fast food chains should not try to lure kids with a treat in order to promote their food. Government should also keep an eye on the types of advertisements being broadcasted for the toys and video games, checking they are not promoting any sort of violence.
