## Behavioural Interview Questions

- Behavioral interviewing asserts that the best way to predict future behavior is to determine past behavior. Behavioral interviewing is designed to minimize personal impressions that can affect the hiring decision.
- By focusing on the applicant's actions and behaviors, rather than subjective impressions that can sometimes be misleading, interviewers can make more accurate hiring decisions.

### Why should you prepare for a behavioral interview?

- Candidates who prepare for behavioral interviews are better prepared - even for traditional interviews.
- Using behavioral answers works well with inexperienced interviewers.
- Companies that employ behavioral interviewing have predetermined the skill sets they require for a particular position. These skill sets could include decision-making and problem-solving, leadership, motivation, communication, interpersonal skills, planning and organization, critical thinking skills, team building, and the ability to influence others. The company determines the skill set by doing a detailed analysis of the position they are seeking to fill.

### How Behavioral Interviews Are Different from Traditional Interviews

- Instead of asking how you would behave in a particular situation, the interviewer will ask you to describe how you behaved.
- Expect the interviewer to question and probe (think of "peeling the layers from an onion").
- The interviewer will ask you to provide details and will not allow you to theorize or generalize about several events.
- The interview will be a more structured process that will concentrate on areas that are important to the interviewer, rather than allowing you to concentrate on areas that you may feel are important.
- You may not get a chance to deliver any prepared stories.
- Most interviewers will be taking copious notes throughout the interview.

### How to Prepare for a Behavioral Interview

- Recall recent situations that show favorable behaviors or actions, especially involving course work, work experience, leadership, teamwork, initiative, planning, and customer service. Prepare short descriptions of each situation; be ready to give details if asked.
- Be sure each story has a beginning, a middle, and an end, i.e., be ready to describe the situation, your action, and the outcome or result.

### STAR Method

- Be sure the outcome or result reflects positively on you (even if the result itself was not favorable).
- Be honest. Don't embellish or omit any part of the story. The interviewer will find out if your story is built on a weak foundation.
- Be specific. Don't generalize about several events; give a detailed accounting of one event.
- Practice your behavioral stories using real-life examples. It is very difficult to make up behavioral stories, which is why behavioral interviewing is becoming more popular. By practicing, you will be able to recall with confidence your past accomplishments. Interview Questions - Set 1 Practice and get comfortable with these common job questions and answer samples before our interview, and we'll feel more confident while giving much better answers.
- We recommend spending some time getting comfortable with what we might be asked, what hiring managers are really looking for in our responses, and what it takes to show that we're the right man or woman for the job.

1. Can you tell me a little about yourself?

- School info
- Experience in field
- Top qualities/attributes, accomplishments, or skills
- Why do you want to be in this field of work / this position?
- To answer, walk them through our background, starting at how we began our career or our current line of work.
- Take them through key accomplishments, key career moves we've made, and end by sharing what we're looking to do next in our career and why we're job hunting.

- **Sample answers:**
- I started my career in Marketing after graduating with a Business degree in 2011. I've spent my entire career at Google, receiving 3 promotions and 4 awards for outstanding performance. I'm looking to join a smaller company now, and take on more leadership and project management.

2. How did you hear about the position?

- This is one of the simplest question and answer scenarios in any interview, but that doesn't mean it can't ruin our chances at the job if we answer incorrectly.

- **Sample answers:**
- I saw the job posted on a website, and the position seemed interesting so I wanted to learn more.
- I found the position while looking for jobs online.
- Your company was recommended to me by somebody I worked with in a previous job and had heard good things about your organization.
- I heard about it from a friend.

3. What do you know about our company?

- Our primary goal is to show we've done our research or knew about their company before applying. If we do this, we'll be fine.
- If we don't seem like we know anything about them, we'll come across as desperate – somebody who will take any job they can find. And that's going to make us unattractive to any good employers out there.

- **Sample answers:**
- From what I read, your company is one of the leaders in providing security software to other businesses. I read the list of clients on your website. Do you mostly serve Fortune 500 clients? I saw a couple of big Fortune 500 companies mentioned on the list, including ... and ... .
- You're one of the largest investment banks in the US. Your headquarters is in Raleigh, NC, and you have 25,000 employees worldwide based on what I read on your website.

4. Why did you apply for this position?

- This is your chance to tell them why you're interested in working there (something about the organization) and why you'd be good at it and happy doing it, and to show your enthusiasm.
- We need to sound like we want the RIGHT job and that we're being picky. Companies want the best performers, and the best performers are picky in their job hunt.
- Stay away from negatives and complaints too. Do not bad-mouth our current company or boss. Focus on the positives of the company we're interviewing with.

- **Sample answers:**
- I've heard great things about the work environment here from a few colleagues. And when I saw this job posting, it seemed to match my skills very closely. For example, I saw on the job description that you need somebody who's an expert in MySQL programming. This is what I focused on in both of my previous positions, and was even the focus of my academic work before graduating university. I consider myself an expert in MySQL and it's a skill I hope to continue specializing in.
- Since beginning my career, I've wanted to work for a larger organization in this industry, and I know you're one of the leaders in this space. I'm very interested in your services, especially the mobile applications you're building recently, so I'd be excited to come here and grow my skills with an organization like yours.

5. Why should we hire you?

- What makes you stand out compared to your peers - how would you be a great employee? Summarize your top strengths and skills for THIS job and tell them about your work ethic (what kind of person you are to work with).
- Try to talk about them and how we'll help them. What will be better for them if they hire us? What will we improve for them?
- And show we've done our research. Make it clear that we know what this position involves, and we're ready to perform the tasks.

- **Sample answers:**
- I read on the job description that you're looking for someone with experience in software programming. I've done that for 3 years and can immediately help you accomplish software programming.

6. Why are you looking to leave your current company?

- If we chose to leave on our own terms, stay positive and focus on what we wanted to gain from the decision, rather than bad-mouthing or focusing on negatives we wanted to avoid.

- **Sample answers:**
- I was hired for a project management role, but over time that changed and I was no longer being given the opportunity to do the work I was interested in. I left to pursue an opportunity that I felt was more aligned with what I've chosen to focus on in my career.

7. What are your greatest professional strengths?

- List 3 of your top strengths that would be helpful in the job you're interviewing for, then give a short sentence explaining why it's a strength for you.
- Answer it well and it's one of the best ways we can show off our skills and show that we stand out among other candidates.
- Choose 1 to 3 attributes we want to mention (depending on whether the question asks for one strength or multiple) and cap it there.
- We'll want to think strategically about what skills will position us as qualified for the job and a good fit for the company.
- Does the position require client interaction? Communication and relationship building make sense.
- Or if the environment is fast-paced and constantly evolving, our ability to multitask, adapt, and learn quickly would be good to highlight.

- **Sample answers:**
- I think some of my greatest strengths are my communication skills and willingness to take initiative. During my last internship, when I was helping to manage several social media accounts, I made sure that everyone on the team was on the same page and knew what our messaging strategy was by taking the initiative to send out a weekly email to keep the team up to date and to seek feedback. This ended up being so helpful that the weekly social media update was incorporated into a full-time staff member's responsibilities.

8. Tell me about a challenge or conflict you've faced at work, and how you dealt with it.

- Give an example, use the STAR method.
- It's important to say that you would give the person time to say what they had to say, to hear them and validate their concerns, then deal with the issue and try to rectify or explain the situation, and that if that doesn't work, you'd get a supervisor or manager.
- Focus on a specific work-related challenge and talk about how you overcame obstacles, used it as a learning experience, used the resources around us (including people/colleagues if applicable), and ended up with a positive result!
- That's how to answer this interview question. Keep it work-related, not personal.

- **Sample answers:**
- In my last job, we were facing a tough deadline and my boss was out for the day. Our client was expecting a project to be delivered by 5 p.m., but we were far behind schedule. I took the lead on the project, delegated tasks to the four other team members in a way that I thought would utilize everyone's strengths best. And then I re-organized my own personal tasks so I could dedicate my entire day to contributing to this project as well. The project was a success and we delivered the work on time. I went on to lead more projects after that, and used what I learned to be a better project manager.

9. How much money are you looking to earn?

- Unfortunately, this question is left off of many lists of job interview questions and answers examples.
- But it's extremely important, and the wrong answer here can cost us thousands of dollars in the negotiation later on.
- Stand your ground and tell them we don't have a number in mind yet or aren't sure.

- **Sample answers:**
- Right now, I'm focused on finding a job that's the right fit for my career. Once I've done that, I'm willing to consider an offer you feel is fair, but I do not have a specific number in mind yet, and my priority is to find a position that's a great fit for me.

10. Why do you want to work here?

- This is very similar to the question: "Why did you apply for this position?"
- Show them that we know what their job involves (at least as much as we could learn from the job description and company website), and that we're excited to be interviewing for this position.

- **Sample answers:**
- I've been actively searching for jobs since graduating with my Nursing degree. I'm interested in intensive care and emergency medicine, and I've seen your hospital mentioned as having one of the best ER's in the region. I thought the job description matched up well with my background and saw some of my personal strengths mentioned, like multitasking and being able to thrive in a fast-paced environment, so I'd love to begin my career here.

11. What is your dream job?

- Career counselors like to think about good jobs as the intersection of our skills, interests, and values.
- That's a good way for us to approach it as well. Talking about our skills will give us an opportunity to sell them a bit—after all, it's an interview.
- Our interests will show our investment, and our values can help illustrate our fit with the company.

- **Sample answers:**
- I've thought about this before, and I know I would want to keep honing my skills in ... as well as learn more about... .
- In terms of job content, I'm interested in work that involves ... and ... . I've been curious about things like this ever since ..., so I would definitely want that to be part of my dream job.
- Based on my skills and interests, in my dream job, I would want to ... as related to ..., ideally in a company where I could ... and .... These are both really important to me, and I'm excited to see that they seem to be equally important to this company.

12. Why did you leave your last job?

- If we chose to leave on our own terms, stay positive and focus on what we wanted to gain from the decision, rather than bad-mouthing or focusing on negatives we wanted to avoid.

- **Sample answers:**
- I left for an opportunity to advance my career.
- My department brought in a new manager, and I felt it was the right time to leave.
- I was hired for a certain role, but over time that changed, and I was no longer being given the opportunity to do the work I was interested in.
- I didn't feel there was an opportunity to grow or advance further in that role, so I decided a change would be best for my career.
- I had been with the organization for a number of years and wanted to experience a new environment to continue growing.

13. What other companies are you interviewing with?

- Hiring managers are curious about what other companies we're interviewing with for a few reasons.
- They might want to scope out the competition, see how serious we are about the industry, or even gauge their likelihood of landing such a star candidate.

- **Sample answers:** If we're interviewing for competitors:
- I do have a couple of interviews coming up soon with ... for senior marketing positions. But I can tell you that, based on what I know, this position has exactly the kinds of challenges I'm looking for in my next role. If we're interviewing in other industries:
- I'm interviewing with a few companies for a range of positions, but they all come down to delivering an excellent customer experience. I wanted to keep an open mind about how to best achieve that goal, but so far it seems that this role will really allow me to focus all of my energy on customer experience and retention, which I find very appealing. If we're not interviewing anywhere else:
- I'm still pretty early in my job search. I've applied to a number of opportunities that will allow me to use my skills in data visualization to help educate clients, but this position is most exciting to me. In fact, I think this position is a particularly good fit for my skill set because I can leverage my significant experience working with complicated data sets.

14. What are your greatest weaknesses?

- Give only one even if they have weaknesses. Don't focus on the weakness, just state it and explain how you can compensate for it OR have started working on it and made some improvement on it.
- Don't give a personality trait as this is very hard for a person to change, instead give something that either doesn't impact your ability to do the main part of the job or a technical skill that may be part of the job that you don't have much experience with yet but could learn quickly because of another one of your skills or strengths.
- We never want to say we struggle working with others, or we're bad at resolving disagreements, or taking direction from a manager, etc. Those things will get us rejected in the interview.
- So pick a specific skill, but pick something that won't severely impact our ability to do this job.

- **Sample answers:**
- I'm not particularly strong in social media marketing. For the first few years of my career, I focused entirely on email marketing. That's still what I specialize in, which is why I applied for your Email Marketing Manager job. But I've realized it's also helpful to understand the principles of social media marketing because some of the strategies that work there also work well in email. So I've started spending a couple of hours a week of my own time studying and learning this new area, and it's helped me a lot.

15. What type of work environment do you prefer?

- Ideally, one that's similar to the environment of the company we're applying to. Be specific.
- Although most places have a section on their sites devoted to explaining culture, they tend to be filled with phrases like "dedicated to customer satisfaction" and "we encourage our employees to grow." That tells us a whole lot of nothing.

16. What's a time you disagreed with a decision that was made at work?

- Brainstorm a few more questions that could potentially come up based on the position we're applying for and our particular situation.
- For example, say we tell that story about standing up to the director of marketing when asked to talk about conflict with a previous supervisor.
- We eloquently move through the story about how we shared our hesitation about the new marketing campaign to no avail, but once the initial numbers came in, it was clear that we were right.
- We triumphantly showed the performance to the director, and she agreed to scrap the campaign.

- **Sample answers:**
- I learned early on in my professional career that it's fine to disagree if you can back up your hunches with data.
- In short, it's not that I'm an amazing multitasker; I just set and review my priorities frequently.

17. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

- Pick a work-related goal of where we'd like to be five years from now, and make sure it's slightly challenging or ambitious-sounding.
- And make sure to share a goal that is related to the type of job we're interviewing for.
- We want to sound like the experience we'll gain in this job fits our long-term goals.

- **Sample answers:**
- I'm glad you asked. In five years, I see myself taking on more responsibilities, either through management or higher-level individual contributions. I am not sure which path will make sense to pursue, but I know my goal right now is to build a strong foundation and gain valuable experience so that I'll have a successful future in this industry.

18. Can you explain why you changed career paths?

- Have a target audience and speak directly to it. It's super important for any job seeker.
- We're not going to be able to just list out our job history and expect a financial services hiring manager to instantly deduce what we have to offer.
- Instead, we will need to angle all of our messaging in a way that makes it obvious what we're trying to achieve and why we're heading in that direction.
- A good rule of thumb is that if we're worried about how a certain position or experience is going to be perceived on our resume, there's a good chance that someone is going to make the exact conclusion we don't want them to make.
- That said, we should plan to go on the offense and manage the message.
- For instance, say the moves we've made along the way make us look, at least on paper, like a bit of a job hopper.
- It's best to add a quick statement in each section of our resume that briefly explains the jump.
- Think through how we're going to present our choices and career path to a potential employer, present them briefly and confidently, and then refocus the discussion on our commitment to this role and what we can walk through that company's doors and deliver.

- **Sample answers:**
- Following a family relocation to Dallas..." (makes the job switch obvious) or "After a significant corporate restructure..." (makes it clear that our job was axed).

19. Tell Me About a Time You Failed

- This is a common interview question that employers ask to see if we're able to learn from mistakes and bounce back when things don't go our way.
- Ideally, talk about how we used that lesson to get a different outcome next time we were presented with a similar challenge (e.g. how we turned a past failure into a future success).

- **Sample answers:**
- In my most recent position, I had recently been promoted to Supervisor and was managing the department on my own right before the department closed. An employee was acting out, and I confronted him in front of everybody. It made the situation worse and caused a lot of distraction for every employee on the floor. I failed to lead properly in this situation and spoke to my manager the next day to discuss what I could have done differently. We both agreed that I should have handled this in private with the employee, by asking them to step inside my office with me. If I had done this instead of reacting the way I did, the situation would have turned out much better. From that point onward, I am always conscious of whether a discussion with a team member should occur in public or behind closed doors, and it made me a better leader.

20. How would your boss and co-workers describe you?

- This is our chance to use the words of others to talk about our own positive traits.

- **Sample answers:**
- Actually, in my most recent performance review in May, my direct supervisor described me as someone who takes initiative and doesn't shy away from hard problems. My role involves a lot of on-site implementation, and when things go wrong, it's usually up to me to fix it. Rather than punting the problem back to the team, I always try to do what I can first. I know she appreciates that about me.
- One thing I've noticed is that I'm always the one people turn to for recommendations on how to handle a new event or program—the latest fundraiser that I just told you about would be one. I have a lot of institutional knowledge, which helps, but I think the reason people come to me is because I work through what a new program might look like very methodically. If you were to ask my colleagues, I'm confident they'd describe me as logical, organized, and meticulous.
- I don't want to speak for anyone else, but I'm pretty confident my colleagues would describe me as thoughtful. I'm the one in the office who remembers everyone's birthdays—and I'm hard-working, since I never leave my office until it's been dark out for a couple of hours. My boss in particular would say I'm very knowledgeable about audience development; it's why I kept taking on more and more responsibilities in that domain.

21. How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?

- Give an example using the STAR method:
- Describe the SITUATION/TASK at hand.
- Explain what ACTION you took.
- Explain the positive RESULT.
- A great approach is to talk through our go-to stress-reduction tactics (making the world's greatest to-do list, stopping to take 10 deep breaths), and then share an example of a stressful situation you navigated with ease.
- The thing people assume about these questions is that they're all about the story. And it's a critical component.
- But even if our story isn't exactly what the interview question asked for, if it's framed well and we go the extra mile to tell the interviewer what he or she should take away from it, we'll actually end up making a stronger impression.
- So, don't stress too much about having the perfect stories lined up or the exact relevant experience. Instead, focus on the messages we're trying to communicate to the hiring manager, and back them up with the stories that we have.

22. If you were an animal, which one would you want to be?

- Seemingly random personality-test type questions like these come up in interviews generally because hiring managers want to see how we can think on our feet.
- There's no wrong answer here, but we'll immediately gain bonus points if our answer helps us share our strengths or personality or connect with the hiring manager.
- Since this question almost never has a "right" answer, the key to responding well is mostly about answering enthusiastically and coherently - not what the content of our answer is.
- If being funny comes naturally to us, this is a great outlet to use some SFW humor. (If it doesn't, now's probably not a good time to start working on it.)
- Once we've shown that we're game and excited to tackle new problems, we've won half the battle.
- Come up with a stalling tactic to buy yourself some thinking time, such as saying, "Now, that is a great question. I think I would have to say... "

23. What do you think we could do better or differently?

- No matter what role we're interviewing for (engineering, sales, marketing), we should always use the product before our first interview (and ideally, a few times).
- If hired, our goal will be to create value for the people who use that product, and being a user yourself is the first step.
- Doing this will also help us determine whether we can be passionate about the company and product as well as convey that passion to our interviewer.
- Now that we're familiar with the product, be ready with ideas for how we'd like to improve it in our role.
- What new features would we be most excited to build?
- How would we engage users (or re-engage existing ones)?
- How could the company increase conversions?
- How could customer service be improved?
- When we're interviewing with a start-up, our goal is to ensure that the job is a great fit for us, and to convey that to our interviewer as well.
- When we do, we'll be in a better position to negotiate our offer and get started once we accept it—full of ideas on ways to hit the ground running.

24. Are you planning on having children?

- Any questions related to our family status are technically illegal, but employers often ask them to get a read on our future commitment to the job and company.
- Tailor our answer to speak to that concern, gracefully avoid the illegal part of the question, and turn the conversation back to our job-related strengths.
- This answer sample assures the interviewer that we're committed to our professional growth, but doesn't promise them anything in terms of our future—and lets us steer the conversation back to a job-related topic.

- **Sample answers**
- You know, I'm not quite there yet. But I am very interested in the career paths at your company. Can you tell me more about that?

25. What do you like to do outside of work?

- If someone asks about our hobbies outside of work, it's totally OK to open up and share what really makes us tick.
- Do keep it semi-professional, though: Saying we like to have a few beers at the local hot spot on Saturday night is fine. Telling them that Monday is usually a rough day for us because we're always hungover is not.
- It goes without saying that we should find out everything we can about our potential place of employment ahead of time.
- Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and the company's website and blog all provide us with information that will help us go to a job interview confident and prepared.
- Before we go, try to find out who we'll be meeting with, whether it's an HR representative, our would-be boss, or the CEO.
- Why? Our interview answers and conversation topics should vary based on the person we're speaking with, and by knowing who we'll be talking to, we can spend time thinking through how we might connect with each of these people.

26. What are your salary requirements?

- Unfortunately, this question is left off of many lists of job interview questions and answers samples.
- But it's extremely important, and the wrong answer here can cost us thousands of dollars in the negotiation later on.
- They do not know if we're any good or if they even want to hire us.
- So we can't command a high salary right now. If we go too low with our price, they'll hold us to it later.
- Go too high? We'll scare them off before they even know what we're worth!
- Stand our ground and tell them we don't have a number in mind yet, or aren't sure.

- **Sample answers:**
- Right now I'm focused on finding a job that's the right fit for my career. Once I've done that, I'm willing to consider an offer you feel is fair, but I do not have a specific number in mind yet, and my priority is to find a position that's a great fit for me.

27. Do you have any questions for us?

- Always have a few questions prepared to ask the employer - this shows your interest?
- Focus on the job & what you'd like to know about it - like "what would you say is the most challenging part of the job?" or ask about one of their projects or something you're interested in knowing.
- NEVER ask about pay/wage, vacation, perks, benefits - that is to be discussed once you get an offer.
- Do not ask about salary, benefits, time off, or anything that isn't related to the work.
- Wait for them to bring it up, or until we know they want to offer us the position.
- If we don't ask good questions to each person we speak with, we're very unlikely to get hired.

- **Sample answers:**
- Yes, I have a couple of questions actually. The first thing I wanted to ask: is this a newly created position, or did somebody hold this role in the past? And if so, what did that person go on to do after this position? Interview Questions - Set 2

1. Tell me about yourself.

- A lot of jobs require someone who can think on their feet or present ideas with crispness and clarity. This question provides employers with an early preview of your core skills, your personality, and your ability to respond to an unstructured question.
- **Sample 1:** From a very early age, I've been a problem solver. I was that kid who would take apart anything so I could see how it worked—and then try to put it back together.
- **Sample 2:** I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning in all parts of life, personal and professional. In my professional life, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and...

2. What is your greatest strength?

- Employers want to see if you can strike the right balance between confidence and humility. Hiring managers also want to get a sense of how self-aware and honest you are and align your strengths with the role at hand.
- **Sample 1:** What I bring to the team is a strong record in relationship building. I'm happiest when I'm engaging and strategizing about how we can help one another. I find that in sales, some people can be overly transactional. I think my superpower is in establishing more meaning...
- **Sample 2:** My greatest strength is strategic thinking. I am often able to quickly spot patterns and issues and create alternatives before my teammates even realize there is an issue. The way this shows up in my work experience is through risk mitigation. As an example, I was starting a new project with a new team in an industry I had never worked in before. The team seemed to think that the project was very straightforward...
- **Sample 3:** Over the last several years, I've realized my strength as an analytical thinker who is extremely thorough and organized. In my current role, I run multiple 360 marketing campaigns and ads across social touchpoints — all at the same time. So it's really important to consolidate all the campaign results together and across different channels to see which platform actually generates the highest ROI. I've been able to boost the success of past projects by looking...
- **Sample 4:** My greatest strength is that I am equally at ease when talking to executives, business users, and engineers. I come from an engineering background, but I have a very strong understanding of the...

3. What is your greatest weakness?

- The interviewer is assessing whether your weaknesses will get in the way of doing the job. Employers are looking for humility and whether you're committed to learning and growing. This is a place you can showcase what you're doing to improve.
- **Sample 1:** I get excited when people on my team brainstorm about big new ideas. I sometimes get so caught up in the moment that I volunteer to do too much. I know this can be a distraction in ways that put me at risk of not getting work done properly or missing deadlines. I've been reflecting on why this happens. As I've become more conscious...
- **Sample 2:** In my current role as a product manager, I'm responsible for specific feature building. So, I work with a lot of cross-functional teams like engineers and designers. I think one thing that I can always improve on is patience, taking time to really see and understand other people's perspectives — especially considering...
- **Sample 3:** I have a strong desire to succeed, which generally serves me well. But I've realized that it can also be a blind spot if I'm not being honest with myself about what's possible. A few years ago, I was working on a remote control, and the schedule was very tight. We were trying to go from concept to mass production in six months, and there was a high amount of pressure. I made the decision to continue with the factory...
- **Sample 4:** I have worked on my inclination to hold back on giving tough feedback. A few roles ago, I'd just been promoted to management and joined a project that my boss was leading. The work was about 30% baked when I joined, and I knew right away that it wasn't strong. I spoke up, but not strongly enough.

4. Why should we hire you?

- This question tests how persuasive you are. Interviewers want to see if you can make a calm, confident case for yourself, even if they're acting skeptical. They're looking for factual and compelling answers.
- **Sample 1:** I've got both the experience and target audience rapport that you're looking for. I've built two corporate training programs from scratch and developed the kind of interactive video programs that you're looking to create. When employees fill out feedback forms, they speak highly of my professionalism and clarity that they've...
- **Sample 2:** Having worked in strategy and sales roles across different geographies, I believe I am uniquely positioned to add a lot of value to this general managerial position. What separates me from most is my ability to take a holistic view of the business, set the vision, and translate that into a set of strong strategic solutions. Given my experience across different functions, I...
- **Sample 3:** As a data scientist, I've demonstrated my ability to answer business questions, as well as advise strategic marketing decisions by providing in-depth data analysis with various technical skills, such as SQL and R. Part of my role has been to evaluate a $30M marketing budget and make recommendations. A recent marketing strategy that I proposed eventually drove growth of 10% for...
- **Sample 4:** My resume demonstrates that I've been successful with the key responsibilities of this role: managing teams, developing strategic sales plans, and delivering quarterly targets. I've been managing teams for...

5. Why do you want to work here?

- Interviewers want to understand what prompted you to apply for this job. They don't want candidates who are indifferent to where they work. Instead, they want someone who offers very specific reasons for why they want this job.
- **Sample 1:** The first thing that prompted me to apply is your commitment to service. I've been a customer for five years since I first bought a house. We had a big storm that damaged my roof last year, and I was impressed by how caring and prompt your customer service representatives were as I worked through it. I'm also excited about...
- **Sample 2:** I grew up in a household that only used your products. Even when we faced tremendous financial difficulty, my mother would always buy razors manufactured by your company – that's when you realize the role you play in the lives of your consumers is much more than cleaning. You make life a little bit easier, allowing people the time, space...
- **Sample 3:** I have spoken to people who worked here previously and I was always highly impressed by how highly they spoke about the company and how well they developed themselves. I admire your mentor program and have always believed that mentorship is key to a company's success and an individual's personal and professional growth. I see this opportunity as a way to contribute to...
- **Sample 4:** I understand that you're looking for a leader who can implement and scale your data analytics platform. Over the course of my career, I have implemented data analytics platforms for 3 companies.

6. Tell me about a time you showed leadership.

- Employers want to understand your capacity to step up and handle tough situations that undoubtedly arise in the workplace. They want to know when you've seen an opening to lean in and lead with good judgment.
- **Sample 1:** Recently there was a situation where my manager needed to take medical leave and was unable to come into work for a few weeks. This coincided with a major deadline that he was leading. I knew that if this project wasn't completed on time, we were at risk of losing a major client. I looked to my right and my left,...
- **Sample 2:** I was working on a high visibility project and during production, two members on my cross-functional team had different approaches to a problem that we were facing. They both wanted credit for being right, and we were at a stalemate. To move forward, I needed to help align the team. I wasn't their reporting manager but I was...
- **Sample 3:** During a recent project, I was responsible for helping to improve the margins of an existing product line used by multiple customer segments. The product had multiple elements of design, manufacturing, and software support. Leadership had been eyeing cost-cutting efforts for some time. My first step was to clearly understand the situation and how the product had become less profitable. So, I sat down with the design, sales, marketing, and operations teams...
- **Sample 4:** A few years ago, I took over the Web Operations team of a major company. This was a new area for me, and when I stepped into the role, I immediately identified a clear need to completely rebuild 35...

7. Tell me about a time you were successful on a team.

- If you can show that you've helped a team move through a challenge, you probably have strong communication and interpersonal skills. These kinds of "soft” skills are in high demand and make people successful in their jobs.
- **Sample 1:** I was asked to work on a high-profile project that included collaborating with a new team and tons of people across a larger organization. We were spread out across the globe, which meant time zones were tricky, and we could never meet face-to-face. Communication was starting to get confusing, and people were losing important details. It became apparent that this project was going to fail if we didn't have...
- **Sample 2:** While working for a major airline, I was on a team that was tasked with jointly determining the growth plans for a joint venture we operated in partnership with two other airlines. Naturally, the team was made up of individuals based around the world, each with very different views on the economic and competitive landscape. At first, our plans clashed significantly. One challenge we were trying to solve in our term sheet was how to adjust...
- **Sample 3:** I joined a team 6 months after the MVP launch, which was moderately successful but short of management expectations. Without a real roadmap, the team was just running small experiments to drive incremental gains. I quickly realized that we'd need to do more than that to realize the long-term vision of the product. To gain the trust of my new team, I focused on what could be improved in the immediate future.
- **Sample 4:** As part of developing a product roadmap for a CRM product line, I'm proud to have uncovered an unmet need during a user empathy session. One of the pain points that kept coming up was around...

8. What would your co-workers say about you?

- Interviewers want to know if you'll fit in with the team. This question can also help you highlight your strengths without feeling like you're bragging.
- **Sample 1:** I think my coworkers would tell you that I'm the one you turn to when it's time to make sure everyone stays motivated and on track to pull off big, high-profile projects. In one of my LinkedIn recommendations, my supervisor refers to me as the "Human Glue”, which is something...
- **Sample 2:** I would expect that most coworkers would describe me as driven. When I join teams or start on projects, I spend a lot of time understanding what's most important about the work, which is a huge motivating factor for me. Once I lock in on what matters most, I share it with the team so we're all invested with a common purpose. Being driven allows me to share what some have called my "infectious...
- **Sample 3:** My coworkers have told me that I am a technical leader who sets ambitious goals, reliably delivers work on time, and shows empathy to each team member. In a recent peer review, I received great feedback for being a team player. One of my coworkers needed to take some time off to address some pressing personal issues. He wasn't...
- **Sample 4:** Years ago, I read a book called Seeing Yourself as Others Do. The book posits that while we are young in our careers, we can get away with being aggressive in our work style and stepping on toes to get...

9. Why do you want to leave your current role?

- Employers say they want to hire people who are running "to” a role as opposed to running "away.” However, they are also interested in your honesty when things haven't worked out and will give people second chances when they demonstrate hunger.
- **Sample 1:** I'm eager to find a new opportunity and grow. As you can see, I've been doing the same kind of work for two and a half years, and I'm starting to stagnate. My company doesn't have a role open for the next step up, unfortunately. So, I'm excited about the opportunity of becoming a sales manager at your company. The new role will let me use the skills I've developed in my current role like making cold...
- **Sample 2:** I believe that the key to long-term professional growth is gathering critical, foundational experiences. In my case, my aspiration is to lead a large multinational business in a general managerial capacity. To get there, I have identified a set of enabling experiences, and have been very intentional in choosing my roles and assignments so far. While I have learned an immense...
- **Sample 3:** I've enjoyed my time with my current employer, and have grown a lot in my role. In the past 2 years, I've successfully shipped several products that turned out to be very successful. I believe that the next big trend for product development will be centered heavily around mobile shopping. My current company is looking at a possible move in this direction within a number of years, rather than months. I'm interested in joining your team...
- **Sample 4:** I enjoy my current role and am not actually actively pursuing a change. I am, however, very open to intellectually stimulating and challenging opportunities that will allow me to provide value. I'm interested in a role where I am responsible to deliver and actively...

10. Describe your most challenging project.

- Employers want to get a sense of what ‘challenging' means to you. They also want to know how you handled the situation in a calm way. They're looking for a storyline to prove that you can turn a bad story into a good story.
- **Sample 1:** In my current role, I was in charge of leading a major marketing campaign for a new product launching nationwide. The project was challenging both because of how large it was and because it involved constant communication with at least seven teams inside my company. Even though I tried to share the same information with everyone, it was clear that not everyone was on the same page. Partway through, I discovered that some...
- **Sample 2:** I was brought into a project right before the ramp, when the existing team ran into a blocker issue. They were severely constrained in both resources and time, and didn't have the bandwidth to address it. Obviously, there was a lot at stake. The expectation was that I would quickly solve the issue, but I was coming in completely cold and the team was stressed and resistant...
- **Sample 3:** While working for a major airline, I needed to adjust a financial model that shared revenue between all the airlines in our partnership. The model used a common industry metric, RASM, to calculate unit revenue — based on the number of seats in an aircraft. But without a universal standard for airplane design, this metric favored some partners over others. To fix this issue, I had to establish a standard without unwanted...
- **Sample 4:** I was tasked with implementing a uniform data platform for a large, multinational company with tens of thousands of employees. It had to be done in such a way that it could be used by teams spread out...

11. Tell me about something you've accomplished that you are proud of.

- This question assesses how you define professional success. If the story resonates, the employer will want you to do similar things at his or her company. You should focus on the impact and outcomes.
- **Sample 1:** When I first joined the company, I noticed that the existing monthly budgeting process was quite time-consuming and inefficient because it was highly manual. There were errors and inaccuracies, and I took the initiative to implement a new budgeting template to automate the process and make it simpler. I developed automated calculations...
- **Sample 2:** In my role on the innovation strategy team, I helped create a long-term innovation pipeline which led to multiple product launches for a critical business unit. While the company was a market leader in the space, we had been rapidly losing market share over the last few years. My first action was to identify the root cause of our declines. Through a detailed analysis, I identified that...
- **Sample 3:** Only a few months into my role, I was asked to lead another product area because the team hadn't been successful after several attempts. I realized that the org itself posed a challenge. We were essentially operating as 3 separate teams on 3 different sites, in 3 different time zones. So, my first step was to visit each site to build trust and learn more about their priorities, since we would need buy-in...
- **Sample 4:** In the last year, I led the launch of an entirely new e-commerce business channel within my company. Data showed us that users have a tendency to impulse buy on social media — and I saw an opportunity to embed a shopping feature in our social media app. With just a lean team of two...

12. Can you explain your employment gap?

- This question isn't designed to rule you out - it's a good sign if you get the interview. Interviewers want to get more context about the gap and whether you're still going to be a great fit for the role, despite the gap.
- **Sample 1:** Yes, so a few years ago I was working in Seattle as a global finance manager. I loved my job and got to travel all over the world. My dad, who lives in Michigan, was diagnosed with dementia that same year, and my mom was having a hard time giving him the level...
- **Sample 2:** Looking at my resume, you'll notice I have an employment gap of 5 months. I was relocating internationally and had to go through the administrative process of procuring my travel visa and work authorization permits. During this time, I couldn't legally be employed abroad. The time off was a blessing. It allowed me to recharge my batteries and use the time to stay current with industry...
- **Sample 3:** The 2-month gap on my resume was intentional. I wanted to leave space to prepare for a big international move and take the opportunity to travel. I'd been heads-down for much of my career, and this seemed like an ideal time to unplug. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19, I didn't end up moving or traveling, and the new job fell...
- **Sample 4:** After experiencing a layoff, I created a list of things I wanted to accomplish with the time. I had always wished for more time for creative pursuits like fiction writing, so I spent time developing a TV pilot and framework for a 10-episode arc. Letting my creative juices flow was very rewarding. I found the routine...

13. What are your salary expectations?

- If this question arises early, odds are that the interviewer is really asking: "Can we afford you?” If it arises much later, the interviewer may be hoping that your salary requirements are aligned with what they have budgeted for this role.
- **Sample 1:** I've been doing some research on the market for the role of Sales Analyst. What I found from LinkedIn's salary tool is that here in Chicago, base pay for these jobs tends to run between $61,000 and $71,000. Half the companies pay bonuses...
- **Sample 2:** Based on my current compensation and market research from resources like Glassdoor and levels.fyi, I am seeking a base salary within the range of… I've seen similar roles that are offering $[dollar amount]. My specific experience and years in...
- **Sample 3:** After researching market ranges from multiple sources online and taking into account my education, experience, and location, I'm targeting roles with base salaries in the range of [dollar amount]. Of course, I'm also taking into account opportunities...
- **Sample 4:** It's important to me that any new role is positive from a work standpoint. I want the work that I'd be doing to be impactful, and I want to know that I can contribute meaningfully to the organization. That's why I'm most interested in this role: My personal values and ambitions are aligned with the company's...

14. What do you like to do outside of work?

- Interviewers want to know you're going to be enjoyable to have around and not just that you have the hard skills for the job. Use this question to set yourself up as interesting, fun, curious, or a go-getter.
- **Sample 1:** A lot of my spare time lately has been dedicated to teaching myself how to shoot and edit instructional videos. I've been a garage-sale shopper for several years, and I sell my finds on eBay to pay down my student loan debt. So far...
- **Sample 2:** I really love backpacking in different countries, especially with different cultures than the one I grew up in. I find that it allows me to disconnect and recharge from everyday life, while growing and learning something new. To date, I've backpacked either alone or with friends in over 20 countries, across...
- **Sample 3:** Outside of work, I enjoy fitness training, perfecting my golf swing, writing and recording music, and taking care of my dogs. This year I will be releasing my 4th album, which is all-instrumental, featuring classical guitar. I play every instrument and record tracks...
- **Sample 4:** My wife and 5 children are my top priority. As a family, we stay very active and enjoy outdoor activities like camping and waterskiing. I played collegiate soccer and when 3 of my children joined teams, I took up coaching. I became so involved that the city requested my...

15. Tell me about a time you had to manage conflicting priorities.

- Employers want to see how you handle competing priorities, understand the implications of missing deadlines, and can stay cool under pressure.
- **Sample 1:** I was asked at the last minute to help with a major project. The deadline was just a few days away and the project had gotten derailed. As I was working on this first urgent project, I was approached by two different clients with pressing requests as well. These conflicting priorities overwhelmed me at first. Then I came up with a plan to prioritize the tasks I was given based on their level of importance. I determined which clients...
- **Sample 2:** As part of my role in Business Development, I managed multiple programs. Due to changes in business needs, I had to update the training for the sales team for one program, while working on launching a new capability within the other. Both were high priority and time sensitive, and required major time and effort on my end. To ensure that deadlines were met, I met with the respective internal and external partners to set expectations...
- **Sample 3:** During my role as Manager of Transportation Procurement, I was tasked with creating reports for procurement and presenting them to our Business Intelligence department. I was selected for the project because of my engineering experience. After creating the reports, the BI team told me that they were backlogged for at least 6 months — which was an unacceptable timeline for my manager. I was hesitant to break protocol, but explained...
- **Sample 4:** When I worked for a technology company in the 3D printing space, their org had me reporting directly to a VP of North American Sales, as well as the global VP of Sales based in Tel Aviv. This dotted line structure led to inherent priority conflict, as I was taking direction from 2 different department heads with very different expectations. I was not able to perform my role effectively with multiple managers, and it...

16. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

- Employers want to determine how serious you are about your career and whether your goals match the goals for this job. Employers don't expect you to offer up a specific title you want. Instead, they want to know what you hope to accomplish.
- **Sample 1:** In the first two or three years, I plan to immerse myself in the position by leveraging my strong Excel knowledge to develop automated reports and processes. The goal would be to improve efficiency...
- **Sample 2:** My professional experience has provided a strong foundation and invaluable insight into my strengths, interests, and areas of opportunity. In the next 5 years, my aim is to continue to build strong relationships and trust by establishing myself as an expert in my field. This will require dedicated investment both in and outside of my role, gathering new perspectives from partners, colleagues,...
- **Sample 3:** I really enjoy my current position and have been happy to contribute to the success of the company. Within the next 5 years, I see myself taking on greater responsibility through a senior leadership role. I feel that my experience, communication skills, and creative strengths would well position me to lead a nationwide...
- **Sample 4:** In 5 years' time, I see myself advancing to an executive-level role leading the broader marketing function or leading the company's effort to be a digital-first brand. That being said, I've always seen myself as a business leader first, marketer second. In order to be a well-rounded business leader, and given the global nature of the company, I would like to do an international assignment within the...

17. Describe your leadership style.

- Good leaders can explain their values and priorities in a few words. This is a test to see if you can explain yourself. It also helps to determine whether your approach meshes with the company's own culture.
- **Sample 1:** For me, good leadership is about finding the best analytical approach while still caring about the people on the team. Last year, I took charge of a digital marketing campaign that wasn't getting any traction. I realized our team members didn't know what was expected. We worked together to build new metrics. I was given more responsibilities...
- **Sample 2:** I subscribe to McGregor's Theory Y of management, which emphasizes the importance of "participation." This theory suggests that people take pride in their work and act responsibly for the most part. I firmly believe that everyone wants to do their level best, and will do so when they have a clear vision, the right tools, and a sense of ownership. This informs the way I lead and inspires my goal of creating a positive,...
- **Sample 3:** In a word, supportive. I think it is important to understand the unique strengths and blind spots of my team members and direct reports. Knowing how to work with a range of experience, skills, and working styles plays a big role in the success of a team. We recently hired a new analyst who had limited experience in the industry and required...
- **Sample 4:** There are many aspects to my leadership philosophy, but the foundation is psychological safety. Right or wrong, I want to give the people around me, reporting to me, and partnering with me the ability to truly and honestly express their opinions without fearing any retribution or impact. That includes people overtly disagreeing with me, pushing back, or expressing an emotion...

18. Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake.

- Being able to admit to a mistake shows maturity and personal accountability. Employers want to know you're self-aware and that you learn from past experiences. Errors are inevitable in any job - it's how you handle them that matters.
- **Sample 1:** In my first job, my manager asked me to develop several forms of tracking projects. I said "yes” because I wanted to do everything my manager asked me to do. But as I started working on the project, I realized I didn't understand the overall goal. And the project ended up creating templates that didn't...
- **Sample 2:** During my first few months in network planning, I worked to launch a new international route for a major airline. Months of work and detailed analysis go into every new route as many candidates are narrowed down to a few worthy of a multi-million dollar investment. Regardless, this work needs to be done at a rapid pace and with a high level of confidentiality.
- **Sample 3:** While working in channel sales for a technology company that sold storage area network solutions, I made the mistake of announcing a new break/fix service that was not approved or rolled out internally yet. I had jumped the gun, assuming it was ready to go. As a result, over 50 global channel partners received the new program, and some of them had already initiated quotes for end users. Once I realized...
- **Sample 4:** As a second-year digital executive at a leading snacks brand, I had an opportunity to either renew past sponsorships or seek new opportunities to associate our brand with top sports and entertainment properties. When I extended our contracts in fantasy football, I had my doubts about the effectiveness of the partnership and the overall lack of novelty after so many years. Compared to the actual NFL,...

19. Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult person.

- Employers know that difficult people are everywhere, and situations come up frequently. Explaining how you've been able to handle a challenging person in a mature way demonstrates your ability to manage difficult moments successfully.
- **Sample 1:** My boss assigned me to a big project that entailed working across multiple teams. I had to collect and analyze data that would help her make an informed decision about a new service we were introducing to our customers. One of these individuals I needed to collect data from had a bit of a difficult personality. He was late to provide the data, and when he did provide it, it was incomplete or inaccurate. Without getting the right information from him, I knew...
- **Sample 2:** My company had kicked off a highly controversial cross-functional initiative. I was the project lead with a team of three Product Managers, though I was not their direct manager. One of the Product Managers was many years my senior and a level above me in the organization. Throughout the process, I found that he was working around me, looping me out, and stalling the process by surfacing problems...
- **Sample 3:** As a Business Analyst, my job was to create requirements documents or pitches for new projects to present to a board of directors for approval. One of the board members was notorious for poking holes and asked us to gather more information, causing significant delays. This made stakeholders very unhappy. I reached out to this board member to...
- **Sample 4:** I don't really believe that there are inherently difficult people. In my experience, different backgrounds and levels of information can make it difficult to understand another's point of view. As a product manager, I really wanted to push for a shopping feature within our app. I saw a great opportunity to open a new potential revenue stream, but one of our key stakeholders...

20. Tell me about a time you had to persuade someone.

- This question is all about sizing up your emotional intelligence. Interviewers are looking for problem solvers, not shouters. Strong answers showcase your listening skills and your ability to guide people to better choices.
- **Sample 1:** The day before a major management review, I was told we only had ten minutes to present our project. We had originally been promised fifteen. Most of our team members agreed to shorten their remarks. One person refused to make changes. I suggested that we sit down over coffee and talk about it. I started by listening,...
- **Sample 2:** At a key moment in my previous role, my team was trying to balance the growth of our user base and the safety of users. We were exploring many solutions for this problem, and my role was to align the team. Our engineering manager had a strong perspective on a solution that was technically straightforward but did not fully address both needs. Our designer wanted to implement a more complicated but comprehensive solution. I believed that the latter seemed like...
- **Sample 3:** I had just started leading special projects for the CEO of our wholesale division. He was very particular about data models and gave line-item feedback, which caused extra work for the team. I felt strongly that there was a better way to complete the work. My boss and I pitched a new model, but it was shot down. I realized that he...
- **Sample 4:** As a software engineer, I had to persuade my marketing and sales teams that deploying a new version of the software was the right thing for our consumers and clients because the existing version was...

21. Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone.

- Occasional conflicts are a fact of life. Interviewers want to see if you can work through those tensions in a respectful way. If you helped steer things toward a good compromise, that's a big plus. Signs of anger or bitterness will count against you.
- **Sample 1:** My team was given a new goal: to sell our product to a new customer segment that we hadn't served in the past. The group had strong opinions about the approach we should take. In spite of their voices, I had concerns about their strategy; I thought it may fail as it didn't align with the client's core needs. But I was in the minority...
- **Sample 2:** During my time on the growth strategy team, I partnered with various brand and finance teams to create a promotion and events calendar to maximize portfolio performance. This was especially challenging because each brand team was only responsible for their brand's performance, while my job was to help ensure that the entire portfolio succeeds. This created an inherent discord in the exercise. In the past, teams would look back at the previous year's events with the goal of essentially replicating them.
- **Sample 3:** A few years ago, I was asked to give a presentation on best practices in procuring transportation. One of my suggestions was to change the lane hierarchy for which we procure rates as well as changing the hierarchy we used to build routing guides in our transportation management system. The Director of Transportation did not agree, which created some tension. I explained to the leadership team how the change would allow...
- **Sample 4:** My organization had prioritized the growth of a certain part of the business, and we were all in a room discussing the best way to drive it. The cross-functional group had starkly different opinions. One senior-level team member suggested that we "force” the customers to make necessary changes by threatening to pull funding. This set off warning sirens in my mind because my team would be responsible for carrying this out. I responded by acknowledging...

22. Tell me about a time you created a goal and achieved it.

- Strong answers reassure interviewers about your ambition and your determination to press ahead. Pick a trivial goal, and you're at risk of being tagged as a slacker.
- **Sample 1:** In my line of work, most top performers have MBAs. I couldn't afford to step out of the workforce for two years to earn one. But I promised myself to do everything possible to earn an MBA within three years while working full-time. I found...
- **Sample 2:** I was two weeks into my first role with a new company when the leader of our business unit requested to showcase all the technology my team was working on, plus two brand-new demos in the grand opening of our New York City office — in just six weeks. My manager tagged me to lead the charge. Most of our projects weren't client-ready, which would mean lots of coding and testing to do in a short period of time. I don't think anyone thought we'd have it 100%...
- **Sample 3:** While working as a digital analyst for a top snack brand, sales growth had been slowing for our company. After discovering that our key customers - people between 16-24 year-olds - were heavily over-indexing on mobile, I persuaded the team to execute a massive pivot: shifting 25% of our digital spending towards top mobile channels. We began to liaise with leading sports platforms and leveraged their flagship app. Envisioning true integrations, not just tiny banners that go unnoticed, we...
- **Sample 4:** As a marketing executive in the beer industry, we faced a tough challenge when data showed that our top male consumer group started drinking less beer and more spirits. Historically, the beer industry has never catered to women, which created a market share gap of over 30 points between male and female drinkers. I set a goal to reduce this gap by at least 10 points and create $2 million...

23. Tell me about a time you surpassed people's expectations.

- Employers want to know they are hiring high-quality people. If you have a story about surpassing an expectation, you've probably gone above and beyond the call of duty, and that's a great thing!
- **Sample 1:** As a young professional, I was given a small event to manage for my company's senior executives. We originally expected about 50 attendees, but then the CEO decided to participate too. Suddenly, the event became much bigger with 400 people attending. We had to organize buses, food, scripted content, speeches, and the program...
- **Sample 2:** In my role as Business Analyst, I was responsible for analyzing and implementing strategies for key products. Due to a combination of an organizational restructuring and employee attrition, my team of four shrunk down to a team of two: my new leader and me. At this stage, I combined some key skill sets. I used my technical expertise to create and automate...
- **Sample 3:** I had only been in my new role at a leading professional services firm for a few months when I got the call: "Can you make it to Atlanta tomorrow morning for a pitch meeting with a leading telecom company? We need all hands on deck!” It turned out that the senior management closest to this client couldn't make the meeting, so I led an 8-figure pitch. I leaned on...
- **Sample 4:** I had been in my new role within the organization for just one week. My predecessor had left the relationship with our customer in a questionable place and as a result, they informed us that they'd be...

24. Tell me about a time you had to handle pressure.

- Some jobs are high-stress and interviewers will test you to see if you can handle the heat. You'll get partial credit for talking about your heroic efforts to get everything done, but you'll get more points if you've enlisted allies.
- **Sample 1:** I was working on my company's big quarterly project update when two team members left unexpectedly and we were short-handed with three weeks to go. I convened an urgent strategy session where we identified all the projects they were involved in and mapped out our action plan. We shared the most important tasks within...
- **Sample 2:** During my time as an analyst for a major airline, I was pulled into a special project where we were asked to look at a potential merger scenario with another carrier. Due to the confidentiality of the project, I was unable to work with peers or use my normal channels for support, and was required to meet a demanding work schedule in order to complete our evaluation in the allotted time. While this...
- **Sample 3:** When I was working as a Systems Integration Manager, I was responsible for onboarding a client to our TMS (transportation management solution) on a tight timeline. This was challenging because the client managed their own transportation independently. None of their data or invoicing for freight was centralized, and I was missing a lot of information. We needed to hit our target go-live date because my company had already hired employees for the account...
- **Sample 4:** I led a rapid, three-month-long company-wide initiative to help customers reduce their carbon footprint. To accomplish this goal within an aggressive timeline, I led a team of five subject matter experts to design a new service offering targeting the manufacturing, mining, chemical, and electronics industries. We assessed their current carbon and environmental waste output, and...

25. Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly.

- Interviewers want more than a one-time success; they're looking for signs of a well-tested strategy that helps you gather information and put it to use. They also want to know if you feel comfortable with rapid learning.
- **Sample 1:** When I started in my role, I thought I was quite good at Excel. I had told my employer that I knew how to calculate complex formulas, but I quickly discovered that my experience was well behind that of my peers. I didn't want my boss to know that I was trailing in my capabilities just as I stepped into the...
- **Sample 2:** In my role as a new manager, I was given a new tele-acquisition channel to manage with little guidance. The channel was brand new to me and my team leader, so we had to get up to speed quickly. I had to learn the channel's end-to-end process, how it functions, and its various nuances to prevent any negative impact on the business during the ramp-up process. I set up time with our internal and...
- **Sample 3:** Due to a change in senior leadership, we had to aggressively rethink our approach to the next evolution of cloud technology. I led a company-wide effort to define and execute a strategy to move towards a subscription-based cloud solution. First, I worked with my team to define our areas of focus, starting from understanding how our products should work in the future based on the needs, behaviors,...
- **Sample 4:** As a supply chain executive, I've always wanted to do an assignment abroad, especially in Mexico where the manufacturing scene is exploding with the creation of new factories driven by government tax credits. My current company has a policy that basic fluency in Spanish is required to be eligible for...

26. Do you have any questions for me?

- This question isn't just designed to make sure you leave with all of your questions answered; it's intended to see if you're prepared and to assess how curious and thoughtful you are.
- **Sample 1:** I do have a few questions. Thanks for asking. We talked a bit about your plans to invest in training opportunities for your current employees, especially those who will be managing the company's transition to a centralized billing system.
- **Sample 2:** Earlier in our conversation, you mentioned that there were some tensions between these two teams. Can you share more about where that comes from, and how you think this will impact me in my role? I'm very excited to hear that you're...
- **Sample 3:** How do you think I should approach the first 30 days in the role to best position myself for success in a new culture? I know that your company has won numerous awards for workplace and community culture...
- **Sample 4:** What do you see as the most critical component of your business today that will contribute to your long-term success? What challenges does your organization…
