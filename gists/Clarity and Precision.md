## Clarity and Precision

- Expression that could have been conveyed through a single word.
- Expressions beginning with "make" that we all use in everyday speech but that will hardly be welcome by our readers.
- Although there's nothing wrong with writing these longer expressions in our first drafts, reducing them to their single-word forms during the editing stage will improve the rhythmic flow of your sentences.

## Redundant Words and Expressions

- If you were charged twice for the same item the next time you shopped at your local supermarket, you would not be happy.
- In writing, the same holds true when you use redundant words and expressions.
- You're writing it twice and the reader is reading it twice.
- What's the point? Emphasis?
